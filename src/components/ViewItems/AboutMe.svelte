<p><span class="h5">Hello</span> there!</p>
<p class="indent">
	My name is <b>{name}</b>, a native Taiwanese born, raised and educated in {location}. I am
	currently a <b>{title}</b>
	working for a local software startup.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	With rare experiences in both software and publishing industry, I am a quick, passionate learner
	with versatile combination of skills. I am creative with an easy-going personality as well as
	down-to-earth working attitude.
</p>

</div>
<br /><br />
<p class="indent">
	I grew up with computers. I played the shareware version of DOOM when I was 10 and self-taught
	myself to write simple (and bad) Quick-BASIC programs when I was 12. I moved on to Visual Basic 4
	in middle school then Visual Basic 6 in high school, mostly writing mini games.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	I didn't know what exactly where I wanted to go. In college I picked a major that I had no
	interest in, and my first job as a overworked programmer frustrated me. I decided to try out one
	of my other interests, which is translating. I had some little reputation in the book circle as a
	reviewer and blogger, and got introduced into the publishing circle.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	After six and half years and the publishing market showed signs of dying quickly if not already, I
	had no choice but to find my next way out. I want back to the software world, at first still in
	touch of publishing, then finally moved back to a pure software business. I learned lots of new
	stuff in the span of a couple of years.
</p>
<p class="indent">
	And this is more of less how I ended up building this site - kind of unexpectedly.
