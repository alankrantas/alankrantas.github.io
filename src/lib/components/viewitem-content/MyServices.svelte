<p><span class="h3 justify">Why does a human writer matter?</span></p>
<p class="justify">
	<i>Why do I even need a human writer</i>, you ask? Why not AI everything?
</p>
<p class="indent justify">
	Generative AIs and LLMs are great - they can indeed handle a lot of text processing work and save
	time. They have answers for everything. For many people, it's tempting to automate the content
	creation process. The quality may not be that great - but hey, we can now produce much more
	content in a much cheaper and faster way, and maybe with less humans.
</p>
<p class="indent justify">
	But AI can be rather unimaginative in the long term (with clear signs of repeated sentences, lack
	of emotions and self-contradiction), especially when there are limited sources to learn and reason
	from. Not everything in your business domain exists online. And what do you know? Writing prompts
	and reference materials in the first place is essential, but often overlooked nevertheless.
</p>
<p class="indent justify">
	We've also heard reports that AI models still suffer from heavy hallucination (<i>37%</i> for GTP 4.5!),
	can be jailbroken, leak sensitive information, and generate little new business value (said Microsoft
	CEO). And a model of an AI service may become "stupider" whenever a new one is released. A model works
	for now cannot guarantee it will perform as well later.
</p>
<p class="indent justify">
	Most important of all - the models have fixed human and language knowledge. The best AIs we have
	now are mostly trained on datasets from at least a couple of years old. It is now known that
	training them bigger doesn't make them a lot smarter. And with so much AI-generated content on the
	web, the risk of model collapse for future AIs has ever been greater.
</p>
<p class="indent justify">
	Quality writing and translating are more like art performances. Instead of predicting words
	mathematically, the writing process is often intuitive, dynamic and nonlinear, with deeper
	understanding and thinking beyond simple prompts. We think more and we are dedicated to make them
	"feel right" - a good article should be unique and engaging, and a good translation finds the
	balanced path between faithfulness and readability.
</p>
<p class="indent justify">
	And the readers will notice when you replace something nice with something mediocre. You may think
	that people cannot tell the difference - but the truth is, they often can.
</p>
<p class="indent justify">
	Are you looking for someone who can give your business an edge in content differentiation, brand
	awareness and better user engagement? Are you having trouble with content quality using ChatGPT or
	alike? Do you believe that genuine content <i>matters</i>?
</p>
<p class="indent justify">If so, I may be the one to help you to get there.</p>
