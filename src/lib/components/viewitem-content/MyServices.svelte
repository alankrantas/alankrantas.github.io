<p class="justify">
	<i>Why do I even need a human writer</i>, you ask? Why not AI?
</p>
<p class="indent justify">
	Generative AIs are useful for general writing; however by design they are trained to write like an <i
		>average</i
	> person with fixed knowledge. They cannot reason well in your specific domain without lengthy, detailed
	prompts, and tend to be unimaginative and repetitive due to the lack of input. Creating reference documents
	for AIs in the first place can be just as challenging.
</p>
<p class="indent justify">
	Quality writing is an art of storytelling, which involves careful researching and organizing
	around the domain, subject and context, while the creation process is often intuitive, dynamic and
	nonlinear, much like painting a picture aesthetically, instead of predicting words sequentially.
</p>
<p class="indent justify">
	As for translating, a competent translator plays a reliable bridge connecting two worlds
	containing incompatible cultural concepts and ways of speaking. No languages can be converted <i
		>word-by-word</i
	> to another, and only one with sufficient understanding can find you the balanced path of readability
	and faithfulness.
</p>
<p class="indent justify">
	Are you looking for someone who can give your business an edge in content differentiation and
	better user engagement? Are you having trouble with content quality using ChatGPT or alike? Do you
	believe that genuine content <i>matters</i>? I may be the one to help you to get there.
